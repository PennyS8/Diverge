Olli: Sorry I couldn't hang out last night. I had practice until 7, and then I was up all-night studying for Mr. Turner's history test.
Juniper: For Friday?
Olli: For today! Remember we voted as a class to move it up? So we could have a pizza party on Friday. [fade start=5 length=35]Which I'm looking forward to, since...[/fade]
Juniper: [i]Oh crap. It is today. I swear I wrote that down. I should have written that down. I didn't do well on the last test, and if this one doesn't go well because I didn't study againâ€”[/i]
Olli: ... and we all know that vegetables are just a culinary term, not botanical one, so technically, fruit not only belongs on pizza, but defines it. You understand.
Juniper: Sorry, I gotta run. [i]Don't panic don't panic don't panic[/i]

Ping!

Juniper: Oh no. I have overdue books. I need to get my library books before I can look the librarian in the eye! She'd be so mad at me![wait = .5] But I don't remember having them at home last night, so they must be around here somewhere...
