Olli: Sorry I couldn't hang out last night. I had practice until 7, and then I was up all-night studying for Mr. Turner's history test.
- For Friday?
- For later this week?
Olli: For today! Remember we voted as a class to move it up? So we could have a pizza party on Friday. [fade start=5 length=35]Which I'm looking forward to, since...[/fade]
Juniper: [i]Oh crap. It is today. I swear I wrote that down. I should have written that down. I didn't do well on the last test, and if this one doesn't go well because I didn't study againâ€”[/i]
Olli: ... and we all know that vegetables are just a culinary term, not botanical one, so technically, fruit not only belongs on pizza, but defines it. You understand.
-  Sorry, I gotta run.
-  I have to... do stuff...

Ping!

Juniper: I want to go to the library. I need to go to the library. It's quiet and calm and there's books and it'll be alright if I go there.[wait=1]
Juniper: Oh no. I have overdue books. I need to get my library books before I can look the librarian in the eye! She'd be so mad at me![wait = .5] But I don't remember having them at home last night, so they must be around here somewhere...

Juni: You're sad.
- No I'm not.
- What are you talking about?
Juni: You look sad. And scared.
- What are you doing here?
	Juni: Wolf and I are doing quiet time.
	Juniper: I forgot I named my bear "Wolf."
	
- Whatcha got there?
	Juni: My teddy. She's doing quiet time with me. Her name is-
	Juniper: Wolf. Why'd I name her that again?

Juni: You're not doing quiet time right. You're being loud.
Juniper: Sorry.
Juni: In...hold...out...hold. In...hold...out...hold... Why aren't you breathing?
- I am breathing.
	Juni: Not the right way. During quiet time you're supposed to take a [i][b]deep breath[/b][/i].
- That doesn't do anything.
	Juni: It can! 
	Juniper: We don't even do quiet time anymore.
	Juni: Why?
	Juniper: At some point, I--we-- just stop.
	Juni: That's a silly choice to make.
	Juniper: Yeah. I guess it was.
	Juni: You should start again. 
	Juniper: I don't know if I remember how.
	Juni: Well, during quiet time you're supposed to take a [i][b]deep breath[/b][/i].
Juni: In for four, hold for four, out for four, then hold for four. Again and again until you get a little bit bored.
Juniper: A [i][b]deep breath[/b][/i].

Juniper: So why are you doing quiet time right now?
Juni: Because quiet time helps me slow down. And sometimes, things feel different after I do quiet time. Even if they didn't really change.
