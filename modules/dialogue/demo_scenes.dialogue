- For Friday?
- For later this week?
Olli: For today! Remember we voted as a class to move it up? So we could have a pizza party on Friday. [fade start=5 length=35]Which I'm looking forward to, since...[/fade]
Juniper: [i]Oh crap. It is today. I swear I wrote that down. I should have written that down. I didn't do well on the last test, and if this one doesn't go well because I didn't study againâ€”[/i]
Olli: ... and we all know that vegetables are just a culinary term, not botanical one, so technically, fruit not only belongs on pizza, but defines it. You understand.
-  Sorry, I gotta run.
-  I have to... do stuff...

Juniper: Sorry.

- I am breathing.

- That doesn't do anything.
	Juni: It can! 
	Juniper: We don't even do quiet time anymore.
	Juni: Why?

	Juni: That's a silly choice to make.
	Juniper: Yeah. I guess it was.
