Juniper: Hello! You're not attacking me!
Shaded Figure: i feel awful. why do i feel awful. i did everything right.
Shaded Figure: i came to class. i studied. i went for a walk. everything. i've exhausted my options.
- Have you eaten anything?
	Shaded Figure: i looked at the food. someone took the last of the good food before i could get to them. so i'm having water for lunch.
	Juniper: I think that's why you're feeling poorly.
- Aren't you missing something?
	Shaded Figure: ohhh... that's right. i'm in the cafeteria, aren't i?
	Shaded Figure: anyway... i couldn't get the only good food. all the other food has an awful texture.
	Shaded Figure: well, except for the chicken burger. but i ate that every day last semester and it tastes like metal now.
	Juniper: Hey, same here!
Juniper: Pro tip: I actually found out that the noodles here are pretty good if you give them a chance.
Shaded Figure: i'm fine with water, thanks. but i need to figure out why i feel so badly.
Juniper: ...
Juniper: [i]to self[/i] I should see if I can find any noodles for them.
